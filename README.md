## Why ?

As the comment [comment from Hacker News regarding "The Art of PostgreSQL" states](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27842351):

Project state:

This project is being actively developed and its APIs might change. All issue reports, feature requests and PRs appreciated.

Remaining Work:

- [ ] dogfooding our queries, plus use the generated types instead of the hand crafted ones
- [ ] Hardcode native functions + operators
