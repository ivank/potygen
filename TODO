- allow table names to be used inside of a cte query

```sql
  WITH
    items AS (SELECT * FROM account_levelisations AS a WHERE a.levelisation_id = $id),
    active_items AS
    (SELECT * FROM items WHERE state = 'Success' AND is_accepted = TRUE)
  SELECT
    levelisations.id AS "id",
    levelisations.quarter AS "quarter",
